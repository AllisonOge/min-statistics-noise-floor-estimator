# min-statistics-noise-floor-estimator
The `min-statistics-noise-floor-estimator` project is an implementation of a noise power or floor estimator based on the knowledge that signal samples with noise will approach a noise only state at some instance in time. The algorithm is written in python using jupyter notebook.
